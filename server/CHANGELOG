Version 1.2.0 -- 25/1/2022
- New dependency: openssl.
- The server communicates with the client using OpenSSL. The communication is encrypted with the latest TLS protocol. Old server versions are incompatible with the client version 1.4.0+.

Version 1.1.0 -- 19/1/2022
- New dependency: libcap.
- Root permissions are reduced during initialization, and when the sniffer is not active. The program only sets the CAP_NET_RAW permission when it's required. 
- Fixed oversight where connecting multiple times to the server made it keep adding interfaces to the interface list.

Version 1.0.1 -- 18/1/2022
- The list of available interfaces is updated every time a client connects to the server, instead of every time the server is started.

Version 1.0.0 -- 8/1/2022
- Initial release
